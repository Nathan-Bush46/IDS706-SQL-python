## Quick Explanation

* 3 Python files that create, test, and log a Python database.
    * [`create database`](src/main_workspace/sql_main.py): Creates a basic database using SQLite3 and Python
        * Performs basic CRUD operations
        * Shows examples of different SQL queries
    * [`log database`](src/main_workspace/sql_logging_example.py): Creates a basic database logger using SQLite3 and Python
    * [`Test database`](src/tests/test_sql.py): Creates a basic database tester using SQLite3 and Python. This tests that the operations on a database behave as expected. It creates a separate DB in memory for testing.
* Note: The python script will not delete the old .dp files between runs. Therefore running the python files multiple times will result in duplicate entries in dbs.

## Set up instructions using VS code + Docker: 
### Docker
1. For Windows, Mac, and maybe Linux, you download Docker Desktop. links can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Follow set up instructions and start the application.

2. In vs code add Dev Containers and Docker extensions 

3. clone repo, restart vs code, and open repo in vs code.

4. should see a pop up to (re)open in devcontainer. Click it and let it run. It takes a bit of time for the first run but is much faster after that. Done.

#### Alternatives to Docker
If you choose not to run docker, use a python virtual environment to prevent conflict with local packages and run the makefile.
 
## Testing

### makefile  
* install

* testing:

    tests all "\*test\*.py" files in src/test/ using py.test then tests all files using py.test --nbval-lax

* lint

* format

* all 

### VS code testing  
1. Can also use the VS-code testing menu in the same way.

## Things included are:

* [`Makefile`](Makefile)

* `Pylint`

* `.devcontainer` with [`Dockerfile`](/.devcontainer/Dockerfile), [`postinstall.sh`](/.devcontainer/postinstall.sh), and [`devcontainer.json`](/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)`

*  [`settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json) for testing

*  A base set of libraries in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
